# Scripts

This folder contains scripts which are the reference implementation of how to use software within OM3 utils.

i.e. run `qsub pbs_make_cice_grids.sh` to create the cice grid for ACCESS-OM3 at all three standard resolutions. After sanity checking, these are then moved by hand to the desired folder to run the model.
